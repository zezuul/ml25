      ">  They have taken advantage of our country.\n",
      ">  No longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  I am going to bring back millions of jobs.\n",
      ">  Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.\n",
      ">  The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers.\n",
      ">  Nations around the world like Canada, Australia, and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.\n",
      ">  It's a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.\n",
      ">  Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.\n",
      ">  According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Switching away from this current system of lower skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits.\n",
      ">  It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families—including immigrant families—enter the middle class.\n",
      ">  And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our Nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws.\n",
      ">  If we are guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program—the building of the Interstate Highway System.\n",
      ">  The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.\n",
      ">  America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East; all the while, our infrastructure at home is crumbling.\n",
      ">  With this $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.\n",
      ">  [Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States—financed through both public and private capital—creating millions of new jobs.\n",
      ">  This effort will be guided by two core principles: buy American and hire American.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Tonight I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better health care.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Mandating every American to buy Government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.\n",
      ">  The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits.\n",
      ">  As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.\n",
      ">  Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State—the State of Kentucky—and it's unsustainable and collapsing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  One-third of the counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them fast.\n",
      ">  They are losing them so fast.\n",
      ">  They are leaving, and many Americans have no choice at all.\n",
      ">  There's no choice left.\n",
      ">  Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan?\n",
      ">  We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken.\n",
      ">  Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Action is not a choice, it is a necessity.\n",
      ">  So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better health care system for all Americans:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  First, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our Government.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Thirdly, we should give our State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.\n",
      ">  And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines, which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care.\n",
      ">  So important.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.\n",
      ">  Every problem can be solved.\n",
      ">  And every hurting family can find healing and hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Our citizens deserve this and so much more, so why not join forces and finally get the job done, and get it done right?\n",
      ">  On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable; to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave; to invest in women's health; and to promote clean air and clean water; and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  An incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an inspiration to us all.\n",
      ">  Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old.\n",
      ">  She was not expected to live past 5.\n",
      ">  On receiving this news, Megan's dad John fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child.\n",
      ">  He founded a company to look for a cure and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life.\n",
      ">  Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter.\n",
      ">  But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.\n",
      ">  If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA, but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.\n",
      ">  In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every American child.\n",
      ">  Education is the civil rights issue of our time.\n",
      ">  I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and Latino children.\n",
      ">  These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.\n",
      ">  As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice.\n",
      ">  But then, she was able to enroll in a private center for learning—great learning center—with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.\n",
      ">  Later this year she will get her master's degree in social work.\n",
      ">  We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.\n",
      ">  The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.\n",
      ">  In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.\n",
      ">  This is not acceptable in our society.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.\n",
      ">  But to create this future, we must work with, not against—not against—the men and women of law enforcement.\n",
      ">  We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is—division.\n",
      ">  It's pure, unadulterated division.\n",
      ">  We have to unify.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Police and sheriffs are members of our community.\n",
      ">  They're friends and neighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.\n",
      ">  We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  And we must support the victims of crime.\n",
      ">  I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.\n",
      ">  The office is called VOICE: Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.\n",
      ">  We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.\n",
      ">  Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose Government failed them.\n",
      ">  Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison.\n",
      ">  Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential, who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.\n",
      ">  But he never got the chance.\n",
      ">  His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine.\n",
      ">  Jamiel, thank you.\n",
      ">  Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis.\n",
      ">  Their husbands, Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of duty in California.\n",
      ">  They were pillars of their community.\n",
      ">  These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.\n",
      ">  Should have never been in our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.\n",
      ">  Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan, and Jessica: I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice.\n",
      ">  Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten.\n",
      ">  We will always honor their memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war.\n",
      ">  If they must, they have to fight\n",
      ">  and they only have to win.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.\n",
      ">  My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.\n",
      ">  Our veterans have delivered for this Nation, and now we must deliver for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  The challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even greater.\n",
      ">  And none are greater or are braver than those who fight for America in uniform.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \"Ryan\" Owens.\n",
      ">  Ryan died as he lived: a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our Nation.\n",
      ">  I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that—and I quote—\"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.\n",
      ">  \" Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity.\n",
      ">  Thank you.\n",
      ">  [Applause]\n",
      ">  And Ryan is looking down, right now—you know that—and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.\n",
      ">  [Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.\n",
      ">  Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom.\n",
      ">  And we will never forget Ryan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.\n",
      ">  Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust, and meaningful engagement with the world.\n",
      ">  It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism, and a cold war, and defeated communism.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  But our partners must meet their financial obligations.\n",
      ">  And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.\n",
      ">  In fact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in.\n",
      ">  Very nice.\n",
      ">  We expect our partners—whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific—to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.\n",
      ">  Have to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also.\n",
      ">  Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.\n",
      ">  My job is not to represent the world.\n",
      ">  My job is to represent the United States of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.\n",
      ">  We must learn from the mistakes of the past.\n",
      ">  We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world—all across the world.\n",
      ">  The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  America is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where shared interests align.\n",
      ">  We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.\n",
      ">  We want peace, wherever peace can be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  America is friends today with former enemies.\n",
      ">  Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.\n",
      ">  This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.\n",
      ">  Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial.\n",
      ">  At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations.\n",
      ">  Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.\n",
      ">  Remington unveiled the first typewriter.\n",
      ">  An early attempt was made at electric light.\n",
      ">  Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.\n",
      ">  Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.\n",
      ">  Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.\n",
      ">  Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.\n",
      ">  American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\n",
      ">  Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.\n",
      ">  And streets where mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before—for all Americans.\n",
      ">  This is our vision.\n",
      ">  This is our mission.\n",
      ">  But we can only get there together.\n",
      ">  We are one people with one destiny.\n",
      ">  We all bleed the same blood.\n",
      ">  We all salute the same great American flag.\n",
      ">  And we all are made by the same God.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began.\n",
      ">  The time for small thinking is over.\n",
      ">  The time for trivial fights is behind us.\n",
      ">  We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past; and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ">  I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.\n",
      ">  I am asking all Members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold, and daring things for our country.\n",
      ">  I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment.\n",
      ">  Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe, once more, in America.\n",
